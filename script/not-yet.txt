<p>For now, we’re working hard on this demonstration of spiffy new CSS3 or HTML5 technology. Come check it out on December 1st!</p>

2 Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana...
<p>...but it certainly isn’t December 2nd yet.</p>
----
3 Get back in your DeLorean, McFly.
<p>Seriously. This is the future. And we demand you wait until the 3rd. Of January, 1955.</p>

4 VISITOR — Y U NO WAIT?
<p>This page will be worth it. Just come back on the 4th.</p>
----
5 Lorem ipsum sit dolor...
<p>That’s all we got so far. We’ll have more by the 5th, promise.</p>
----
6 Lost: Content page for December 6th.
<p>Smallish, kind of scruffy looking. Goes by the name of “/6/index.html”. Definitely not housetrained. We’re sure it’ll turn up on the 6th.</p>
----
7 Just missed it.
<p>This page left just a few minutes ago. Sorry about that, but the wife phoned the bar and told it to come home this instant. But it said it’ll be back on the 7th.</p>

8 Sneaky hobbitses!
<p>Sneaky hobbitses tries to tricks us! Try to see the 8th before it is the 8th...sneaky sneaky hobbitses.</p>

9 Trololo-lolo-lolo-lolo-lolo-loooo
<p>We’re not trying to troll you, but you have to wait a little longer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLczcnld8eU&feature=fvwrel" target="_blank">This should kill a few minutes...</a></p>
----
10 “Erroneous Time Sync Error -13324985” has occurred
<p>Quick, reboot the universe and check back on the 10th!</p>
----
11 You know what’s a fun game?
<p>Sitting here and watching the hours pass until it is the 11th of December. Or just head outside, enjoy the fresh air, and come back later. Your choice.</p>
----
12 BRB

----
13 Don’t you know that skipping ahead to the 13th is bad luck?
<p>The only remedy is to check back on the 13th to see what’s really on this page!</p>
----
14 Here’s a cool $ 1’000’000’000’000 for you!
<p>But not really. While we wait, we thought we’d rent this space out to known spammers. They promised to leave on the 14th. Maybe we should’ve thought this through...</p>
----
15 :(
<p>Nope. Not yet.</p>
----
16 Paper jam
<p>Why does it say paper jam when there is no paper jam...?</p>
<p>We’ll fix this, no problem. Might be a while though. You should come back on the 16th.</p>
----
17 Wait, you must.
<p>Since you spend about 5 years during your lifetime waiting for stuff, we thought these few extra days wouldn’t matter much.</p>
----
18 Halt! Zhis is ein secret area!
<p>&lt;German accent&gt; How zhid zou get here? Zou should not be here! Zhis secret bunker is off limits until the 18th! Guard! Schnell, Kartoffelstock! &lt;/German accent&gt;</p>

19 Waiting sucks
<p>Yes it does. So do empty pages. We’ll fill it by December 19th.</p>
----
20 Still trying, eh?
<p>You must be bored if you kept clicking. May we offer you some refreshing <a href="http://nyan.cat/" target="_blank">Nyan Cat</a> while you wait? We’re all out of everything else at the moment...</p>

21 “Infinity is a very long time, especially towards the end.”

23 You asked for it.
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
