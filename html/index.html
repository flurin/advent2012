              <p>
                This page left just a few minutes ago. Sorry about that, but the wife phoned the bar and told it to come home this instant. But it said it’ll be back on the 7th.

                <h2>Lights, camera, action with getUserMedia!</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                While webcams, video chat and other camera-related stuff has been around for a pretty respectable time, until now
                we had to rely on Flash or other native tools to put them to work. On of the things the WebRTC API offers us is
                access to video and audio input from a user's webcam/microphone. Combined with the powerful canvas element (all
                kneel before the canvas element please) we can do some really sweet stuff.

                <h2>Go column-crazy!</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                With the CSS columns property we can create mult-column layouts. And we don't mean the kind that you have to create a separate div for every column, and you'd never quite
                get the right balancing — regardless of the home-grown tricks you were using. With CSS columns you can create real columns that automatically balance, and the content
                flows nicely from one to another!

                <h2>More effects than a Hollywood movie</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                The web has evolved from a very text-oriented structure into the interactive, experience-rich digital environment we all know and love today. With the waning of Flash
                (which none of us are mourning, FYI), CSS has had to fill quite a few voids left in web-effects. Enter visual effects, made from scratch in CSS. And while it's not exactly
                a web-based Photoshop, it's starting to deliver some very interesting results.

                <h2>Swashbuckling with swashes &amp; other ligatures</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                This one is for all you typophiles out there. For a long time web-typography was an unsightly, borked mess. Luckily, this changed with wide-spread support for @font-face. But still you couldn't use the fonts you
                had to their full extent: all the cool OpenType features like small-caps, ligatures, old-style figures and swashes were reserved for those who used these fonts in print. With the CSS property
                font-feature-settings, that has changed quite a bit.

                <h2>Live events from the server side</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                Live updates have always been kind of a hassle — you had to deal with long polling, flash components or, if you
                went the HTML5 route, you'd have chosen WebSockets. That's no longer the case, you can set up EventSource in
                about 5 lines of code and it works over standard HTTP.

                Wouldn't it be swell if you could notify a user with an important message even if the browser isn't currently in use? Drumroll

      <p>
        We wanted show off some of the cool new features in CSS and HTML that we haven’t had a chance to use in “real” work just yet. These pages are meant to be a
        showcase of what has yet to come. We hope you get inspired by our examples and have as much fun playing with this stuff as we had making it. Season's greetings from
        us <a href="http://twitter.com/digitpaint">@digitpaint</a>!
