                <h2>Painting on a Canvas background!</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                Static backgrounds are old news, yet even the newer methods (however cool they might be) are still about static
                images. Wouldn't it be great if we could create dynamic backgrounds? How about animated backgrounds — we could put
                Nyancat everywhere! Or even creating content-dependent backgrounds? When we combine the power of Canvas with the
                ability to use it as a background, we can!

                <h2>Calc()ulating layouts &amp; backgrounds with CSS</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                Using relative units of measurement like percentages is excellent for creating responsive and fluid
                designs, but it's a pain to combine with absolute units (px, em, and such). The calc() CSS function
                finally relieves that pain, and can give your layouts quite a kick!

                </h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                Not too long ago, a 'computer" was a static object. Weighing a metric tonne, for the most part
                it just stood there under your desk, gathering dustbunnies in peace. It changed somewhat with
                the introduction of laptops — but compared to your phone it still doesn't move all that much.
                And your smartphone records all kinds of interesting information, like movement and rotation
                data. Wouldn't it be great if we could do something with this information? Good thing we can,
                thanks to the deviceorientation event!

              </header>
              <p>
                Multiple backgrounds are a nice thing to have, but wouldn't it be even better if we could cross-fade said
                multiple backgrounds for even more spectacular effects? The CSS Image Values and Replaced Content Module Level 4
                promises that we can, and it has already been implemented in Webkit!

                  How to not lose data &amp; the online/offline event

              </header>
              <p>
                We all know this horror of the web: imagine you had just finished writing a mile-long blog-post. You
                click "save", but good grief, your internet connection has vanished! And with it, all your writing,
                thoughts &amp; musings. No way of ever getting it back. If only the app you used had checked your online
                status and saved your data in localStorage (or something similar)! Or if it would've given you fair
                warning that you're no longer connected, so that you could copy-paste your text into a local document. As
                it turns out, they could have, using the HTML5 online/offline events and the Network Information API.

              <p>
                Today we're going to play with dynamic linear gradients, and all the cool new background
                properties in CSS. Did you know you can influence how the background scrolls in an
                overflowing container? Did you know how to make flexible odd-even colored lines? We do. And
                by the end of this, so will you!

              </header>
              <p>
                Working with Files has always been exclusively a "server thing". No more, enter the File API and his buddies. This API
                allows you to work with files directly in the browsers. You can read, modify, and create them right then and there, and
                let the user save the result.

              </header>
              <p>
                While text-decoration certainly isn't the most cutting edge feature, it is a very useful one. It has been around
                quite a while, but recently got overhauled into the CSS Text Decoration Module Level 3 spec. The new text
                decoration features give you a lot more control than you had before.

                <h2>Bring yo Audio API Boombox!</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                Apart from all the stunning visual stuff you can do in your browser, we also have something in store for tricking
                out audio. The Audio API gives you the means to party hard with some audio. And we don't mean just controls like
                play, pause, etc. — but serious in-browser audio processing. You can generate sounds (waveforms), filter the
                audio, and analyze it.

                <h2>Think outside the box with the Fullscreen API</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                The browser used to be a box that could only fill as much of the screen as the OS permitted. Pages were trapped
                within the confines of the browser window. Time to bust out of this joint! How? Fullscreen API, that's how! With
                the Fullscreen API you can make any element (video &amp; games, anyone?) go fullscreen, that includes the full page
                if you want.

              </header>
              <p>
                Just like the Battery API, the Page Visibility API is a tiny but useful API (let's refer to them as "niche
                APIs"). It tells us wether a page is visible or not. Before this you always had to assume the page was visible,
                even when it was not.

                <h2>Power up the Battery API</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                While not really one of the fancy-pants APIs, the Battery API is quite useful. Especially if you're building an
                offline web-app. We can read out the charging status, battery level, charge and discharge time, all within the
                browser.

                <h2>Lights, camera, action with getUserMedia!</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                While webcams, video chat and other camera-related stuff has been around for a pretty respectable time, until now
                we had to rely on Flash or other native tools to put them to work. On of the things the WebRTC API offers us is
                access to video and audio input from a user's webcam/microphone. Combined with the powerful canvas element (all
                kneel before the canvas element please) we can do some really sweet stuff.

                <h2>Go column-crazy!</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                With the CSS columns property we can create mult-column layouts. And we don't mean the kind that you have to create a separate div for every column, and you'd never quite
                get the right balancing — regardless of the home-grown tricks you were using. With CSS columns you can create real columns that automatically balance, and the content
                flows nicely from one to another!

                <h2>More effects than a Hollywood movie</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                The web has evolved from a very text-oriented structure into the interactive, experience-rich digital environment we all know and love today. With the waning of Flash
                (which none of us are mourning, FYI), CSS has had to fill quite a few voids left in web-effects. Enter visual effects, made from scratch in CSS. And while it's not exactly
                a web-based Photoshop, it's starting to deliver some very interesting results.

              </header>
              <p>
                This one is for all you typophiles out there. For a long time web-typography was an unsightly, borked mess. Luckily, this changed with wide-spread support for @font-face. But still you couldn't use the fonts you
                had to their full extent: all the cool OpenType features like small-caps, ligatures, old-style figures and swashes were reserved for those who used these fonts in print. With the CSS property
                font-feature-settings, that has changed quite a bit.

                Live updates have always been kind of a hassle — you had to deal with long polling, flash components or, if you
                went the HTML5 route, you'd have chosen WebSockets. That's no longer the case, you can set up EventSource in
                about 5 lines of code and it works over standard HTTP.

        <h2>So who are these Digitpaint chaps?</h2>
        <p>
          We wanted show off some of the cool new features in CSS and HTML that we haven’t had a chance to use in “real” work just yet. These pages are meant to be a
          showcase of what has yet to come. We hope you get inspired by our examples and have as much fun playing with this stuff as we had making it. Season's greetings from
          us <a href="http://twitter.com/digitpaint">@digitpaint</a>!
