          Working with Files has always been exclusively a "server thing". No more, enter the File API and his buddies. This API
          allows you to work with files directly in the browsers. You can read, modify, and create them right then and there, and
          let the user save the result.

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>          
        <p>
          The Files API looks a lot tougher than he is, sort of like a guy with a goatee who smokes cigars but actually enjoys
          peppermint tea and horticulture. Anyway, we digress. We basically have to create a <code>new Blob(["data", "more data"],
          {"type" : "text/plain"})</code> object which can contain arbitrary data, which we then get an URL by using the
          <code>URL.createObjectURL(blob)</code> method. The returned URL object can be set as a <code>href</code> attribute for a link (like we did in the
          examples above). Because your browser would normally just open the link, we have used the <code>download="myfile.xyz"</code>
          attribute. With this attribute you force the browser to download a linked document with the defined filename.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          All of this is pretty smooth sailing when you're after text content (except some custom code for IE). Binary content is
          a slightly harder, because you don't want the <code>Blob</code> to do something with encoding on it. Therefore, we have to use one of
          the Typed Arrays (we used <code>Uint8Array</code>, an 8-bit unsigned integer array). A typed array is a view on the <code>ArrayBuffer</code>,
          which contains the actual binary data. We can use this ArrayBuffer to create a binary file like this: <code>new Blob(buffer,
          {"type" : "image/gif"})</code>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          One more thing: in the example above we directly access the chosen file from the <code>input</code> element. This was really easy:
          all we did was access the <code>inputElement.files</code> array (you did know we could do multiple file selects nowadays, didn't
          you?) and created an URL for the first element with <code>URL.createObjectURL(inputElement.files[0])</code>. This URL we assigned to
          the <code>video.src</code> attribute, Bob's (not Blob) your uncle!
        </p>
        
        <h2>So how handy is it, really?</h2>
        <p>
          Pretty damn handy. We didn't even scratch the surface of all the cool stuff you could do with this. Simply put, this API
          really makes working with files a whole lot easier. We can generate them, link them, and directly read them in the
          browser. Many things that required server-side processing can now be done on the client-side.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What else could we do with this?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Build a photo-editor in the browser without storing anything on the server
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Resize uploaded images before we send them to the server
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Great, but can I use it today?</h2>
        <p>
          Support isn't too bad (not too great, either, though). The only ones who have trouble with this are Safari and Opera.
          Safari seems not to like Blob URL's, and Opera does not support Blob URLs at all. IE wouldn't be IE if it wasn't a tiny
          bit different. IE10 doesn't like creating binary Blobs directly, so we have to use the (deprecated) BlobBuilder API.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only browser with full support for the download attribute is Chrome, but we used <code>window.saveAs()</code> to
          have it work in IE10. In other browsers, clicking the link just opens the file in the browser.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Hit me with the source!</h2>
        <p>
          Feel free to look around the differente source files we used for this example.
        </p>

            There are a lot articles on the File API out there, but many are outdated, use deprecated, or removed methods. But
            here are some we used:
