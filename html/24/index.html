          Today we'll have a short look at what (we hope) 2013 will bring us — browser-wise, that is. This is by no means a reliable prediction, and may
          in some cases be plain old wishful thinking. Nevertheless, we want to make a short list of neat things that may or may not come to the web the
          coming year(s). 
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>More layout options</h2>
        <p>
          Internet Explorer already debuted grid layout, flexbox is coming along nicely (the new spec, that is), and we might even get a glimpse of
          template layout. Anyway, grid-layout is quite powerful; read the 24Ways article <a href="http://24ways.org/2012/css3-grid-layout/" target="_blank">Giving Content Priority with CSS3 Grid Layout</a> by Rachel Adams
          for a more in-depth look at this.
        </p>
        <p>
          So maybe in 2013 we may finally be able to build most layouts, including content-priority without having to resort to a bunch of wrapper divs
          and dirty float hacks. We're sure that both we, our designers, and our clients would be happier for it.
        </p>

        <h2>Doing more with the flow</h2>
        <p>
          We've demonstrated some parts of <a href="/21/">exclusions</a> and <a href="/19/">regions</a>, but these are merely the tip of the iceberg. Especially exclusions is pretty damn high
          on the most wanted list. We have long wanted to have content flow in or around arbitrary shapes, and exclusions will allow you to do that. Go
          and have a look at Ryan Stewart's <a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/2012/03/experimenting-with-css-exclusions/" target="_blank">
          Experimenting with CSS Exclusions</a>, and be amazed.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Blending your images</h2>
        <p>
          How many times have you encountered a blend-mode in a file from your designer that wasn't set to normal, but to "screen" or "multiply"? We
          have, more than once. And quite frankly, we were just as dissapointed as the designer when we have to send it back to get it "fixed". The
          functionality described in the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/rawfile/tip/compositing/index.html" target="_blank">Compositing and Blending Level 1</a> spec would allow us to do this without too much fuss. Adobe even has an
          experimental Webkit fork with the spec implemented. Find out more <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/category/features/css-compositing/" target="_blank">about compositing and blending</a> on the Adobe Web Platform Team Blog.
        </p>
        
        <h2>CSS Selectors Level 4 </h2>
        <p>
          Work on the CSS Level 4 has started quite some time ago, and we may see some of the specs seep into browsers somewhere next year. The most
          exiting selector will be the subject selector, with which we can select to which part of the css selectors our CSS should apply: <code>!ul >
          li:only-child</code> would style any <code>ul</code> that only has one <code>li</code>. Read the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors4/" target="_blank">Selectors Level 4</a> spec to see all the awesomeness in progress!
        </p>
        
        <h2>Moar device API's</h2>
        <p>
          In this year's HTML &amp; CSS Advent we've seen quite some device APIs: <code>getUserMedia</code> for webcam and microphone, the Device Orientation API for
          accessing the gyroscope/accelerometer, and the Battery API to get battery readings. And then there was the Geo Location API. We expect to get
          access to more and more device APIs. An example of this is the Vibration API, which gets you access to a device's vibrator. David Walsh
          already put out an extensive blogpost about the <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/vibration-api" target="_blank">Vibration API</a>.
