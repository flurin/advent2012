          Live updates have always been kind of a hassle â€” you had to deal with long polling, flash components or, if you
          went the HTML5 route, you'd have chosen WebSockets. That's no longer the case, you can set up EventSource in
          about 5 lines of code and it works over standard HTTP. One small caveat though: the client can only receive data, not
          send it.
        </p>
        
        <section class="examples">
          <h2>Here is an example</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <figure class="example">
              <div id="loadavg-chart">
                
              </div>
              <figcaption>
                A live updated stat of load averages on this site's server.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <h2>Holy smokes Batman, how does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          We created a new EventSource object with a simple <code>var source = new EventSource(URL)</code>. This opens a long-standing
          connection to the specified URL (if you want to be precise about it, it closes and re-opens the connection every
          60 seconds). As we want to do something with the data that's coming in, we've added an event listener to retrieve
          our messages. This is done with <code>source.addEventListener("message", function(data){ ... })</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's it basically. It's very easy as you just send text over the line and your browser handles all the resuming
          and error recovery for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Serverside we send messages over the opened connection in plain text. Each message is separated with two newline characters and
          consists of one or more lines of text with every line haveing a field name. The data we use for the example above
          looks like this:
        </p>
        
<pre class="code"><code>data: [1.2, 1.3, 0.8]</code></pre>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events" target="_blank" >docs at the Mozilla Developer Network</a> explain the data format pretty well.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Useful?</h2>
        <p>
          Oh yes! The example above is just a small demo, but imagine what you could do with more "eventful" data which you
          offer in real-time to your visitors. It's really easy to set up on the client side, and it isn't that hard on the
          server side either.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          So what could we do with this?
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Create a kick-ass server monitoring application (Think of what we could do if combined with <a href="/1/">yesterday's notifications</a>!)</li>
          <li>Have live stock data displayed</li>
          <li>Push live flight data to a map so you could follow an aircraft's flight path</li>
          <li>Push live sports stats and other data to a visitor</li>
          <li>Less useful but fun: create a live chart of tweets with the word "Xmas" in it</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Great, but can I use it today?</h2>
        <p>
          The support for this is <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=eventsource" target="_blank" >pretty widespread nowadays</a>. The only browser not supporting this is IE10 (who'd have
          guessed?). But given that it's all plain HTTP, there are several Javascript polyfills out there to bridge the gap.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Show me the source!</h2>
        <p>
          Feel free to look around the differente source files we used for this example.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="2.js">The javascripts</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <footer class="footer text">

          <p>
            There is a plethora of sources on EventSource out there and they're all quite useful. Here are some we used:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events" target="_blank" >Using server-sent events</a>" from the Mozilla Developer Network
            </li>
            <li>
              "<a href="http://html5doctor.com/server-sent-events/" target="_blank" >Server-Sent Events</a>" by Remy Sharp of html5 Doctor
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            The back-end application is a simple <a href="http://cramp.in" target="_blank" >Cramp application</a>
            we built. You can find <a href="http://github.com/digitpaint/advent2012-eventserver/">the source on Github</a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We used <a href="" target="_blank" >Flot</a> for the Canvas based chart.
