          The browser used to be a box that could only fill as much of the screen as the OS permitted. Pages were trapped
          within the confines of the browser window. Time to bust out of this joint! How? Fullscreen API, that's how! With
          the Fullscreen API you can make any element (video &amp; games, anyone?) go fullscreen, that includes the full page
          if you want.

        <h2>How would that go, matey?</h2>          
        <p>
          Again, this is an easy to understand and straight-forward API. You can call <code>requestFullScreen</code> on any element in
          the DOM to make it go fullscreen (although fullscreen access is not guaranteed). You can detect when an element
          goes fullscreen by listening to the <code>fullscreenchange</code> event, and check which element is in fullscreen mode by
          calling <code>document.fullscreenElement</code>.          
        </p>
        <p>
          Once an element is in fullscreen mode you can apply specific styles to it with the <code>:full-screen</code> pseudo-selector.
          We used this selector to make the image as wide as the screen in the example above.
        </p>
        <p>
          As there is a significant security risk in this fancy feature, browser-builders took some precautions. Chrome, as
          well as Firefox, won't allow anything to go fullscreen unless it is triggered by direct user action (ie. a click
          or keyboard input). In addition to that, a big message is displayed warning you that your browser is now in
          fullscreen mode. This warning can also be used by the user to deny or allow fullscreen for this window. There are
          some other cases where the browser vendors took precautions, so you might want to look into that before going to
          all out and salting your app heavily with Fullscreen API goodness.

          "<a href="http://feross.org/html5-fullscreen-api-attack/">Using the HTML5 Fullscreen API for Phishing
          attacks</a>" (don't worry, the link is safe — it just describes what happens).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Useful?</h2>
        <p>
          If you're building games or are working with video, it is a must-have. Other things you could do with it include (but not limited to):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make your fullscreen presentations in HTML (we know some of you already do this)</li>
          <li>Full-screen gaming</li>
          <li>Kiosk-style apps (you'd probably need something more here though; wouldn't want people to exit full-screen mode)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Now, how'bout them source?</h2>
        <p>
          Opera is the only one with an un-prefixed version. Firefox, Chrome and Safari support the API but only with a
          prefix. IE is absent from the supported list.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Show me the source!</h2>
        <p>
          Feel free to stroll about, enjoy the fresh sea air and look up the various source files we used for this example.

              Using fullscreen mode</a>" explains most of the basics.
